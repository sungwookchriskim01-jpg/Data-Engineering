    "\n",
    "Now that we know a bit about the metadata of the table, let's randomly sample rows from `movie_info_sample` to explore its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that you know the size of the table from the previous query, **write a query that retrieves 5 tuples on expectation using the `BERNOULLI` sampling method.** That is, if we run the query multiple times, we should get 5 tuples on *average* in our resulting table. The `BERNOULLI` sampling method scans the whole table and selects individual rows independently with `p%` probability. Please see the [course notes on sampling](https://data101.org/notes/1-SQL/truncation.html#sampling) for syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign `p_1c` to a sampling rate that you pass into the `query_1c` f-string using Python variable substitution. Your formula should contain `count_1b`, which is the number of rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Python variable substitution is done correctly, we should be able to change our `p%` probability by simply reassigning `p_1c` and rerunning the query. (For submission please leave `p_1c` unchanged.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also completed the SQL line magic for you; this references the Python f-string `query_1c` you created within a SQL query using JupySQL-specific syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the query, try running the SQL cell many times, and see what you notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "* Don't forget to express `p_1c` in units of percent, i.e., if you want to assign it to a value of 3%, you should do `p_1c = 3` not `p_1c = 0.03`\n",
    "* For a refresher on f-strings and Python variable substitution, see [this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/)."

    "To start, using the `info_type` table, write a query to find which `id` corresponds to a film's MPAA rating.  The query `result_2a` that you write should return a relation with exactly one row and two attributes; the lone value in the instance should be the MPAA rating id number.

The single quote character `'` is reserved for delimiting string constants, while the double quote `\"` is used for naming tables or columns that require special characters.

    "**Hints:** \n",
    "- The way we extracted the MPAA rating in question 2b is very similar to how we want to extract the substring containing the number and isolate the numeric dollar amount as a string. There are multiple ways of doing this.\n",
    "   - Look at the [course notes for `REGEXP_REPLACE`](https://data101.org/notes/1-SQL/strings.html#regexp-replace), specifically the `'g'` flag.\n",
    "   - Look at the [course notes for `SUBSTRING`](https://data101.org/notes/1-SQL/strings.html#advanced-string-functionality)\n",
    "- Be careful when trying to match IDs from one relation to another relation. Take a look at the schema of the relations you are working with, whether in terminal or by referring to the description at the top of the notebook. Ensure both fields reference the same entity. For example, `movie_info_sample.id` does **NOT** refer to the same entity as `movie_sample.id`.\n",
    "- Movies may have the same name! What attribute(s) to uniquely identifies a movie? Check the schema of `movie_sample`\n",
    "- The staff solution found it helpful to make a CTE to create the view. You may make as many CTEs as you find necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminders:**\n",
    "- We will only be using movies with gross earnings counted in the **USA** and that are in US Dollars (**$**). Ensure that your `info` string contains both of these markers. The `info` string contains reported gross earnings as `(non-USA)` AND `(USA)`, so please check that you are not adding extraneous values.\n",
    "    - Look at the [course notes for the `LIKE` keyword](https://data101.org/notes/1-SQL/strings.html#like-not-like).\n",
    "- We are looking at the gross earnings info type (called `gross` in the `info_type` table), with `info_type_id = 107`. Other `info_type_id` values correspond to different information about movies that are not relevant for this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "While it is fine to add CTEs, do <b>NOT</b> create additional <em>views</em> as this may take up significant space in memory. If your kernel is crashing repeatedly, check that you are not creating any views in memory.\n",

    "What do you notice about the summary values generated in `earnings_summary`? We can represent the five-number summary graphically using a [box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). Identify two properties about the boxplot of the data. (You do not need to explicitly create a boxplot, but think about how the summary statistics would be distributed in a boxplot.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Think in terms of about concepts from statistics like spread, modality, skew, etc. and how they may apply here."

    "The earnings data is highly righly skewed, with a few blockbuster films earning far more than the majority, which pushes the mean above the median. At the same time, the spread is wide, with a large interquartile range and extreme high outliers. THis meaning the boxplot would show a long upper whisker and many distant points."
