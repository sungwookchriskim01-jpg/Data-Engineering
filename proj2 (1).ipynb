    "## Due Date: Wednesday, October 8, 5:00 PM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Details\n",
    "In this project, we will explore how the database system optimizes query execution and how users can further tune the performance of their queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project works with the [Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/), an open source collection of baseball statistics from 1871 to 2020. It contains a variety of data, like batting statistics, team stats, managerial records, Hall of Fame records, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find this project's queries to be simpler than in Project 1. However, although the queries may not be as complex, we still expect you to spend ample time thinking through the effects of each of the methods, as reasoning about the tradeoff between different approaches is the goal of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If at any point during the project, the internal state of the database or its tables have been modified in an undesirable way (i.e. a modification not resulting from the instructions of a question), restart your kernel and clear output and simply re-run the notebook as normal. This will shutdown your current connection to the database, which will prevent the issue of multiple connections to the database at any given point, and when re-running the notebook you will create a fresh database based on the provided Postgres dump.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics & Scoring Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each coding question has **both public tests and hidden tests**. Roughly 50% of your coding grade will be made up of your score on the public tests released to you, while the remaining 50% will be made up of unreleased hidden tests.\n",
    "- Public tests for multiple choice questions are for sanity check only (e.g. you are answering in the correct format). Partial credit will be awarded.\n",
    "- Free-response questions will be manually graded. Please answer thoughtfully and concisely in complete sentences, drawing from knowledge in lectures and from your inspection of query plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please see this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPcOGt4gQwHRm1i6pEDlpjNe-1iT-r_-t5IYRYW7YpQ/edit?usp=sharing) for the points breakdown.**"

    "## A Bit About Baseball\n",
    "\n",
    "Intricate knowledge of baseball, baseball history, etc. is **not** required for this project. But a basic understanding of the game can be useful. If you'd like, you can check out the [Wikipedia entry for Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball). In practice, we'd encourage you to avoid coming to conclusions nor doing deep analysis with datasets where you don't have the full context, but for this assignment, the details of the sport are not the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read more about the [Baseball Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame). Baseball players who excel in the sport can be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball, since its inception in the late 19th century, has had an incredible track record of keeping very detailed statistics about even minor aspects of the game. This makes it a fun study for a budding (or well-experienced) data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Briefest of Background:**\n",
    "The game of baseball is played over 9 innings, between an 'offense' (a batter, and folks running around the bases) and 'defense' (a pitcher, catcher, basemen, and others). The objective, like most sportsball games, is to score the most points -- in this case, by the batter hitting the ball and running around the bases. \n",
    "In each game, both the offense an defense have a chance to bat, where players get an \"at bat\" (`ab`) in the database. Each 'at bat' results in the player hitting a home run (and scoring), getting \"on base\" (where they can later try to run to home plate), or getting \"out\". After the offense gets 3 outs, their turn to score is over until the next inning. (There are many more rules than these... but that's enough to make sense of the data.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Bit About the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "To be quite honest, the schema of this database isn't our favorite. It is full of abbreivated column names, mixing data types, and seldom enforces primary or foreign key relationships. The horrors!! Nevertheless, real life isn't perfect, so we'll continue to learn how to explore and get comfortable with unknown schemas. Here are a few general tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "* While foreign keys aren't enforced, anything with an `_id` will have consistent values. (i.e. You can treat these like primary or foreign keys on tables.)\n",
    "* `year_id` is called an \"id\", but it is merely the calendar year in which an event occured.\n",
    "* Many of the game related attributes are ruthlessly abbreviated:\n",
    "    * `ab` is for _at bats_\n",
    "    * `g_` is for _game..._\n",
    "    * `hof` is for _hall of fame_\n",
    "    * Other examples (you don't need to know these, but may come across them):\n",
    "    * `lg` is for _league_\n",
    "    * `gp` is games played\n",
    "    * `1b`, `2b`, `3b`, `hb` refer to 1st, 2nd, 3rd and home base\n",
    "* In the hall of fame table `inducted` is a string value where `Y` means true\n",
    "     * ...but of course, you know that this really ought to be a boolean... \n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally: There is a [handy guide to an R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/Lahman.pdf) of the Lahman Basebase db. Some of the table and column names are styled slightly differently, but this may provide additional context.\n",

In my runs this reduced both execution time and total cost compared to the plain view and the no-view query. In contrast, a regular view is just saved SQL text that gets input at plan time, so it produced the same plan, cost, and almost the same timing as the equivalent query without a view. I didnt choose (A) because a normal view doesn’t by itself lower cost or runtime. Creating a materialized view takes longer than creating a view, since the system must execute the defining query and store the result, hence (J)."
